                    After the events of Chapter 1, a cutscene plays at the end, where Kris convulses and
                    jerks out of bed, slouching towards the center of their room, pulling out their knife,
                    staring at the player, and grinning, cutting to the credits immediately after. This is
                    the cutscene that sparked one of the very first theories in the fandom - the “Chapter 2
                    is Kris going on the Genocide Route” Theory.

                    The roots of this theory date back to 2015, when Toby Fox first released UNDERTALE.
                    <br><br>
                    In UNDERTALE, Toby Fox's first hit indie RPG game, there is a special route that appears
                    when you eradicate all of the monsters in an area (eg, 40 in Hotland). At the end of the
                    route, the player is greeted with a special cutscene where the “secret deuteragonist”,
                    Chara, appears, and the ending sequence plays, presenting the player with a choice: either
                    to ERASE the world and move on to the next, or NOT. Both options lead to the world's
                    destruction, either crashing the game or leaving a black void<span id="fm">†</span>.
                    Resetting the game after this route will require the player to wait 10 whole minutes, then
                    make a deal with Chara, exchanging the protagonist's soul for the ability to reset the
                    world. Playing through the game again after this route will restore everything to its normal
                    state. Still, the endings will change slightly, with Chara appearing at the end of the
                    game in either of the post-genocide true pacifist endings, suggesting that Chara is now
                    in control.<span id="cm">1</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Before the post-genocide true pacifist ending cutscene, just like the normal true pacifist
                    ending, the player is given two options: “I want to stay with you”, which means living
                    with Toriel, or “I have places to go”, which means leaving Toriel. The former results in
                    a post-credits cutscene, where, normally, Frisk is seen sleeping in what appears to be
                    their room, with Toriel walking in, leaving a slice of butterscotch-cinnamon pie, and
                    exiting the room, closing the door behind her, which cuts the scene to black. However, if
                    the ending is post-genocide and true pacifist, then the cutscene extends to after Toriel
                    closes the door, where, seconds later, Frisk wakes up, turns into Chara, turns to face
                    the player's screen, and gives a menacing red glare; the scene then cuts to black,
                    followed by a pitched-down Photoshop Flowey laugh. In the latter, where the player chooses
                    to leave Toriel, the post-credits ending cutscene is replaced by an instant-print (also
                    known as a “Polaroid image”) of Frisk and the rest of the Undertale Cast, alongside the
                    text “THE END” written below in all caps. In the post-genocide true pacifist variant of
                    this, however, Frisk is replaced by Chara, while the rest of the cast's faces are all
                    crossed out in red, with the “<span id="red">THE END</span>” also in red text. This
                    section forms the basis of the whole    theory.<span id="cm">1</span>

                    <span id="fn">
                        † In PC/Desktop versions, the game crashes. In console versions, the screen goes black,
                        wind howling in the background, several seconds after the choice is made.

                <p>
                    Fast forward to 2021, when DELTARUNE Chapter 1 was released. After the events of Chapter
                    1, a cutscene, specifically the Deltarune Chapter 1 ending cutscene, plays at the end,
                    as described and shown in the overview. Off the bat, many parallels can be drawn between
                    the post genocide true pacifist cutscene. In the case of the Undertale "Stay with Toriel"
                    Post-Genocide True Pacifist cutscene compared to the Deltarune Chapter 1 Ending, both
                    take place in their protagonists' rooms at night, with both protagonists, one now being
                    Chara instead of Frisk. Both have an implied affinity for knives and wear outfits that
                    are very similar. Both also give the same red glare at the end of their cutscenes,
                    though Chara is the only one to laugh, likely because they, Kris, would rather have no
                    one wake up during that time.<span id="cm">1,2</span>
